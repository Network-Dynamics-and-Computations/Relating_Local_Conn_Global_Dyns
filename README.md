## Code for reproduction of "Relating local connectivity and global dynamics in recurrent E-I network", Shao \& Ostojic

This repository provides the code to qualitatively reproduce the corresponding figures in the paper - create, simulate, analyse and visualize the locally-defined connectivity, low-rank approximation, and their low-dimensional dynamics.

Please run .py files with the ending '_Fig**', the parameters for each cases are specified within the manuscript, you might need to manuelly adjust them. After successfully running the simulation (RERUN=1), you can save the data in your local folder so that you can retrieve it again to quickly generate the figures (RERUN=0).The results you generate might vary slightly because of the random generating function used in numerical simulations.

We also include the code for S1 Fig and the figure we used in our response letter (R3_Major3_Dynamics_iid_inh.), in case you are interested in these results.

In case of any questions, requests, or problems, please feel free to contact me (ivyerosion@gmail.com)
